sqlite3 sometimes has difficulties going to different machines.
npm uninstall sqlite3
npm install sqlite3 --save
this fixes problems
console has always said npm.js cannot find require. has in every tutorial, program still works
For admin pages, go to adminlogin.html
for general user go to home.html
to run use nodemon js/api-sqlite.js
adminlogin.html login details: username: admin, password: login
